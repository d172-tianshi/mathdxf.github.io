I'm a first-year graduate student from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/).  
Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Financial Mathematics from [Zhengzhou University](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/).  
My research interests include sparse phase retrieval, high-dimensional convex geometry, and real algebraic geometry optimization.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peng Li](https://mathteacher.lzu.edu.cn/system/TeacherProfileqt/content.jsp?id=201) (Associate Professor) of the Institute of Computational Mathematics, [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/), Lanzhou University.
